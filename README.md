# Calculator for fun

- This is just literally a calculator I am making for fun, I plan to create a gui similar to the 
  default "Calculator app" found on most devices.
- This project will be made in python
- I am making this repo public so others may tinker with it or contribute to the project

Some Libraries I might use:
- Pyside
- PyQT
- Flask
- QTpy
